<p>Programming concepts are best learned by practicing them. Each week, I will ask you to attempt exercises outside of class. Since I will also post my solutions as online videos, watching screencasts  becomes an important part of your learning.</p>

<p>A very significant essay in hacker culture is “<a href="http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/smart-questions.html">How to ask questions the smart
way</a>“, which provides
important tips on how to utilize the online community efficiently and
effectively. This page provides tips on how to watch screencasts the smart
way. </p>

<h2 id="dont-multi-task">(1) Don’t multi-task</h2>

<p>Since you can watch the screencasts at a time and place of your own choosing,
it is tempting to watch them while also doing other activities: watching TV,
texting, talking to friends, playing online games, reading FaceBook. However,
your goal is not to simply have <em>watched</em> the material, but to have
actually <em>learned</em> the material, and  there is <a href="http://www.facultyfocus.com/articles/teaching-professor-blog/multitasking-confronting-students-with-the-facts/">mounting scientific evidence showing
that multi-tasking impairs learning
ability</a>. </p>

<p>For these reasons, it is in your best
interest to block all other activities while watching the screencast. Since
most screencasts are less than 20 minutes long, this should not be a huge imposition.</p>

<h2 id="take-notes">(2) Take notes</h2>

<p>When material is already recorded and available at any
time as a screencast, you might not think to take notes because the material is always accessible online. </p>

<p>However, to maximize the efficiency
with which you learn the material, you should take notes on the screencast,
because <a href="http://wac.colostate.edu/journal/vol16/boch.pdf">note taking stabilizes information for retrieval at a later
date</a>.  In other words, your
ultimate goal is to not have to re-watch the lecture every time you need the
information, and note-taking helps you achieve that goal  quickly and
efficiently. Since you are not multi-tasking (see heuristic (1)), you will have the time and
space necessary to take notes on the lecture. </p>

<p>Finally, by recording the
elapsed time into the lecture associated with the material represented in the
note, you can use your notes to later rewatch portions of the material quickly
and efficiently as needed. You can also use your notes to record
questions you have about the material for later discussion.</p>

<h2 id="use-piazza-to-ask-questions-and-discuss-the-material">(3) Use piazza to ask questions and discuss the material</h2>

<p>To learn most efficiently, you should record questions you have as you watch the screencast, then post those questions to the discussion group. Don’t assume that your questions could be resolved by taking more time to re-watch the screencast at some future date.  What if you don’t understand it then either, and it’s too late to ask questions? Trust your current abilities: if you didn’t get it this time around, don’t wait – ask.</p>

<h2 id="watch-in-full-screen-high-definition">(4) Watch in full screen, high definition</h2>

<p>Many of the screencasts involve demonstrations.  You should watch these lectures in full screen mode in
the highest resolution possible (typically 1080) to clearly
see all the user interface elements and be able to understand the procedures most
easily. </p>

<p>Watching in full screen mode also prevents you from seeing other
windows, thus helping to minimize multi-tasking.</p>

<!--For example, here are two
images taken from the same screencast, one viewed at 720p and one at 1080p.
Click on each image to display it full size, and notice how much sharper the
1080p screencast is: 

### 1080p

<a href="http://ics314f13.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/screencast-1080.png"><img class="wp-image-243  " alt="screencast-1080" src="http://ics314f13.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/screencast-1080.png?w=300" width="300" height="178" />

### 720p

<a href="http://ics314f13.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/screencast-720.png"><img class="wp-image-244  " alt="720p" src="http://ics314f13.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/screencast-720.png?w=300" width="300" height="188" /></a>


I have noticed that, at least with the Chrome
browser, sometimes you can select 1080p in YouTube and the screencast is still
displayed in a lower resolution. In Firefox, selecting the 1080p resolution
results in the video quality "gear" icon rotating until 1080p resolution is
ready for viewing. So, if you have problems with Chrome, you might try
Firefox.
