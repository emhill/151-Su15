<p>Create a Pesron and Crowd similar to the BoxCar and Forest classes we have done as practice. “Excellent” is correct and on time, “Satisfactory” indicates correct submissions that were late (or on time with a minor issue), and “Unsatisfactory” submissions were incorrect or incomplete in some way. A score of 6 is excellent, 5 is satisfactory, and 1-4 unsatisfactory (needs improvement).</p>

  Follow the Eclipse project workflow we'll be using for the rest of the semester. "Satisfactory" indicates that working Java code was submitted, but that the Eclipse project was flawed in some way.
