# PWOD1: Hello World GUI

Now that you've run your first Java program, let's run your first **GUI** Java program.

## Instructions

1. *Start your timer*
1. Download [HelloWorldGUI.zip](HelloWorldGUI.zip)
1. Open Eclipse and go to `File > Import > General > Existing Projects into Workspace`
1. Select archive file, hit “Browse”, and select the `HelloWorldGUI.zip` you just downloaded
1. Double-click the project folder, the src folder, and then the default package. You should now see a class file, `HelloWorldGUI.java`.
1. To run the program:
    -  Click on the green play button at the top of the screen **OR**
    - Right-click name.java class and select “Run As > Java Application”
1. Rename the project so that it is `HelloWorld_uLogin` by right-clicking on the project and selecting `Refactor > Rename`
1. Edit the `paintComponent` method in the HelloWorldGUI class so that the blue circle forms an even border around the yellow:
<a href="hwgui.png"><img src="hwgui.png" width="400"/></a>
2. Replace “Hello World” with **your name** and update both circles so your name is centered within them.
2. Run the program to verify your changes.
3. Export your program by right-clicking on your project folder, and selecting `Export > General > Archive File`. Name the file `HelloWorldGUI_uLogin.zip`.
1. *Stop your timer*
