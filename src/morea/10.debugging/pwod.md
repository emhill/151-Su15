# PWOD9: Recursive Sort Debugging

<!--In this PWOD we will see how to refactor an existing Java project so that code changes are easier to make. We began this PWOD in class.-->

{% include wod-times.html Rx="<15 min" Av="15-30 min" Sd="30-45 min" DNF="45+ min" %}

## Instructions


  * If you haven't been following along in class, download the [SortingB.zip](SortingB.zip) and import it into your workspace. 
  * In class we used the debugger to understand `IterativeSorter`. There are 4 bugs in `RecursiveSorter`; it should give the same output as `IterativeSorter`, but it doesn't. Step through the code to identify and fix the 4 bugs. Note down the files & line numbers so you can check your solution.


## Demonstration

<!--*Coming soon...*-->

Once you've finished doing the WOD a single time, watch me do it:
