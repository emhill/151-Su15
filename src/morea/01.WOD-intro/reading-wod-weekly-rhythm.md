# WOD Weekly Rhythm

## Overview

This class meets Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. Weather permitting, we will have a well defined "rhythm".

At the top level, the course consists of a [sequence of
modules]({{site.baseurl}}/modules). Typically, each topic will take one week to cover. 
In some cases, a
module might be split into parts and take multiple weeks to cover.

Each module starts on Thursday and ends the following Wednesday.


## Thursday

The module web page is released. The  module page contains overview materials (online readings and
screencasts) on the material. Â  In addition, it contains experiences consisting of "practice [WODs](reading-athletic-software-engineering.html)" and [online](http://codingbat.com/java) exercises.  The "WODs" (workout of the day) are
short assignments with prescribed times for finishing, along with a solution
video that I provide. You are encouraged to try each WOD without
watching my solution video, then watch the video and repeat the WOD until you
can complete it in the prescribed period of time. 

<!--Many students do the practice WODs two or three times. (And some students do not complete them at
all.) -->

You should complete the readings by Friday, the first practice WOD or online exercises by Monday, and the second practice WODs by the following Wednesday.

## Friday

We cover new material during class on Friday, in preparation for the practice exercises. We will often experiment with the material in class; be sure to bring your laptop.

## Monday

During Monday's class we will review any challenges faced  on the practice exercises and deepen your understanding of the module material for the week.

## Wednesday

Students are given a new WOD that assesses their ability to utilize the skills
presented in the module. There is a time limit for completion of the task.

## Why are WODs timed?

The WOD-driven approach is grounded in a few key concepts:

 * Performance is part of every career.
 * Practice is necessary to achieve top performance.
 * Time is a finite resource.
 * Every module in this class depends on the ones that came before.
 * Graded WODs mimic exam conditions (except that on an exam you're not allowed a laptop).

Your time is valuable. Learning to solve programming problems in a timed situation will give you a strong foundation for solving problems in a reasonable amount of time in the future. It also forces you to focus, and ignore any tempting distractions as you practice. After practicing, I ask you to "perform" by completing a graded WOD in class. This can be thought of like an in-class quiz, except you are allowed your laptop. Since the exams are also timed, you will be preparing each week to succeed on the exams, which are the best predictors of your final grade.
