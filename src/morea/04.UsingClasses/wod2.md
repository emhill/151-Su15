# WOD2: Square Class

So far we have created a Circle and Triangle class. Next we'll create a Square class.

## Instructions

<!--1. *Start your timer* -->
1. If you haven't been following along in class, download the [Shapes Project](Shapes_pwod2.zip) and import it into your workspace.
2. Right-click on your Shapes project and go to New > Class to create a `Square` class. Go ahead and check the box for Eclipse to create a main method.
1. Add 5 fields to this class: `x`, `y`, `width`, `fillColor`, and `outlineColor`. Integers recommended.
2. Add 3 constructors:
    * Default constructor (no parameters)
    * Constructor with 4 parameters (no `outlineColor`)
    * Constructor with 5 parameters (one for each field)
3. Add get & set methods for all the fields
4. Add a `getArea()` and a `getPerimeter()` method & test them in main by creating a Square variable & initializing it by calling one of the constructors.
4. Add a draw method that draws the square. 
4. Add a Square field to your Picture class to test it.
2. Run the program to verify your changes.
<!--1. *Stop your timer*-->
3. Export your program by right-clicking on your project folder, and selecting “Export > General > Archive File”. Name the file “Square_uLogin.zip”.
