# PHW3: Square Class with Outline

So far we have created a Circle and Square class. Next we'll update your Square class by adding support for an outline color.

{% include wod-times.html Rx="<10 min" Av="10-20 min" Sd="20-30 min" DNF="30+ min" %}

## Instructions

<!--1. *Start your timer* -->
1. If you haven't been following along, download the [Shapes Project](Shapes_phw3.zip) and import it into your workspace.
2. Add a new field, `outlineColor`, to the Square class.
2. Update the constructors to support the outline. You should have 3 constructors:
    * Default constructor (no parameters)
    * Constructor with 4 parameters (no `outlineColor`)
    * Constructor with 5 parameters (one for each field)
3. Add get & set methods for the outline color
4. Update the draw method to draw the outline. 
4. Test your Square changes in Picture.
2. Run the program to verify your changes.
