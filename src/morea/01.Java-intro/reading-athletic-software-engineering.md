# WODs: An athletic approach to programming

Learning to program is a skill that requires constant practice, just like learning to play an instrument, a sport, or riding a bike. In this class, we will borrow the concept of "Workout of the Day" ([WOD](http://www.crossfit.com/cf-info/faq.html#General0)) from [CrossFit](http://www.crossfit.com/) and apply it to learning how to program.

As with any learned skill, you are expected to _practice_  before the "show case" (in this case, graded) event. Do you expect to succeed at a track meet or play a lovely flute solo in a concert without practicing? Not likely. Don't expect to succeed in programming without practicing either.

## Rx, Av, Sd, DNF

For each WOD, I provide the following timing information:

  * Rx (As prescribed): Finishing the WOD in Rx time indicates mastery of the material tested by the WOD.
  * Av (Advanced): Finishing the WOD in Av time indicates superior performance.
  * Sd (Standard): Finishing the WOD in Sd time indicates acceptable performance.
  * DNF (Did not finish): If you take longer than Sd time, then you have taken an unacceptably long amount of time.

Here is an example:

{% include wod-times.html Rx="<8 min" Av="8-13 min" Sd="13-18 min" DNF="18+ min" %}

So, in this example, completing the
WOD in 8 minutes or less is "as prescribed", 8 to 13 minutes is
"Advanced", 13 to 18 minutes is "standard", and taking longer than 18 minutes is
unacceptably slow. 

Note that simply stopping work at a certain time does not
mean you achieved the associated standard: your solution must have acceptable quality as well.

## Practice WODs

For each module, I provide practice WODs as homework assignments, which you can time on your own. Before starting a WOD, I recommend you review
and study the associated material so that you do not spend valuable seconds
during the WOD doing "research". 

## Graded WODs

After providing you with time to practice some WODs, I will hold a graded
WOD in class, during which I will time your performance and your solution will be submitted
for grading. For grading purposes, the criteria is that you solve the problem
with acceptable quality under the DNF cut-off time. 

**Your grade does not depend upon whether you performed at Rx, Av, or Sd levels, only that you complete the WOD correctly before the DNF cutoff time.**

Partial credit will be given for correct WODs submitted before the next class.

<!--The general procedure for an assessment WOD is as follows:

  * You have your own WOD"-velope", which is an envelope containing an" index card where we will keep track of your WOD scores.
  * On the day of a WOD, you pick up your WOD-velope from me and fill out the date, and the name of the WOD.
  * Once everyone is ready, I start a timer and give out the WOD assignment.
  * When you finish the WOD, raise your hand. I will tell you your elapsed time. You record that on the index card and I collect your WOD-velope.
  * When the WOD is finished (i.e. at the DNF cut-off time), everyone stops work and submits their program data.
  * After class, I check each WOD assignment and give a grade. I also write down Rx, Av, Sd, or DNF on the index card. You can only receive Rx, Av, or Sd if you complete the WOD correctly and within the time frame for that performance level.-->
